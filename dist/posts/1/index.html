Today, our nation is still separated over an issue that was supposed to have been resolved over 150 years ago. Today, I am supposed to celebrate a nation that still cannot agree that black lives matter as much as white lives. 244 years into the life of our nation I find it necessary to look to the past to find what I can be proud of about our nation. Our founding fathers wrote these initial words to our declaration of independence and they have yet to be fully true for all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shortly before the writing and signing of the declaration of independence, Thomas Paine wrote a pivotal pamphlet entitled "Common Sense" which described why it was absurd for the colonies to do anything but break off from England as the mother country and make their own government. He chiefly wrote about why Monarchies are a sinful and egotistical form of government and that it was essential that we not only leave the monarchy of England, but also not form one ourselves. He opens with these lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Perhaps the sentiments contained in the following pages, are not yet sufficiently fashionable to procure them general favor; <strong>a long habit of not thinking a thing wrong, gives it a superficial appearance of being right, and raises at first a formidable outcry in defense of custom</strong>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though we are not dealing with a debate over the merits of separating from England, this statement is still applicable to Americans today. Many white Americans (myself included) are forced to face the subtle and blatant ways in which we have been habitually racist in our customs over the years. I urge you to consider (as I consider with you) your thoughts, demeanor, speech, and attitude towards the black people around you. Is it consistently different in someway than your interactions with the white people around you? If so, there is likely some habitual custom of racism within you. It is very likely not intentional, but is it there? Do not be eager to defend yourself simply because you have not previously realized the wrong in your heart. Rather be eager to reform into a more loving person.</p>
<p>The self evident truth that all are created equal is one we must call ourselves and each other back to today so that we can take another step towards unity in our nation.</p>
<p>As I reflect on our nation, there is one seeming constant that I can be proud of even today. We were founded on the ideal of reforming into something better than what we came from. We saw that ideal continue in the abolition of slavery and we are seeing it again today in the protests and discourse over the value of black lives. We are a nation whose very lifeblood is the ideal of changing what is not yet right.</p>
<p>While I still have mixed emotions about celebrating our country today, it is that continual push to reform ourselves that I have no hesitation being proud of and celebrating. So, today, as we are fighting to reform to be a nation that is for more of the people, I can say that I am proud to be an American in at least that respect.</p>
